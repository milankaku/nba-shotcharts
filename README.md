Create heat maps for NBA players

## What is it

**nbaheatmaps** is a library used to create heat maps of a NBA player. Heat maps help visualize a player's shooting location and frequency of shooting in that same area. This gives us an idea of a player's tendencies and strengths/weaknesses when it comes to scoring. This library was built with Python using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.
